# 1 | Data Binding & Directives
## Introduction
In this session we will cover basic usage of the HTML Syntax in Angular. You will learn how to use [interpolation](https://angular.io/guide/interpolation) to incorporate calculated strings in text, [property binding](https://angular.io/guide/property-binding) and [event binding](https://angular.io/guide/event-binding) for communication between the visual and functional layers of your application.

We will also cover [built-in directives](https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives), which bundle functionality for modifying the DOM and making your site respond to your data.
